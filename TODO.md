# TODO

* create multiple val and test splits? for final evaluation at least

BASELINES:
* SimilaR


try different architectures
modify encoders (dropout, normalization, regularization - probably small improvements)

lstms, SuperSAGE, resgnets, very shallow architectures
isomorphism tests with GNNs
