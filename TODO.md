# TODO

* create multiple val and test splits? for final evaluation at least

* implement some kind of baseline (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/similarity.html)

BASELINES:
* edit distance (tokens)
* string tiling
* MOSS? - doesn't work for R
* graph similarity measures
* SimilaR
